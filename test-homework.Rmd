# Question 1

Below we will read in the Boston housing project data. The distribution of the
data is located [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names).
To make sure that the code below works, click:

Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location

```{r read_data}
housing <- read.table("housing_data.txt")
colnames(housing) <-
    c("crim",
      "zn",
      "indus",
      "chas",
      "nox",
      "rm",
      "age",
      "dis",
      "rad",
      "tax",
      "ptratio",
      "b",
      "lstat",
      "medv")
```

Make a plot of `crime` versus `medv` in the space provided below. Commit your
changes and push the updated .Rmd document, along with the resulting PDF file.

```{r test_plot}
### plot goes here
